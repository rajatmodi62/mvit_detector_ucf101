this repo runs mvitv2 for semantic activity detection on a normal decoder which vidcapsnet uses. 
- i am using the slowfast as a library to import the models 
- also implemented my own version of checkpointers, etc.
- now this is  capable  of importing any model across any of the facebooks libraries. 
- as someone wise said: simplicity is the best thing .
